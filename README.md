# React heatmap component

Work in progress.

Two versions

One version randomly generates a value prop between 0-4 to each 'commit' object,
to simulate a number of commits. Each cell/day's color is conditionally rendered
based on its value:

```
{date: date, value: 0} -> bg-color: #ECEDF0;

{date: date, value: 1} -> bg-color: #9be9a8;

{date: date, value: 2} -> bg-color: #40c463;

{date: date, value: 3} -> bg-color: #30a14e;

{date: date, value: 4} -> bg-color: #216e39;
```

One version is an empty grid where the user can paint the cells by clicking on
them.

## On my todo list:

Things to fix:

- looking at the last cell, the day of the week doesn't fall where it should
  visually, revisit the layout
- finish the UI: missing a chevron-down on contribution settings

Things to implement:

- separate the 2 versions in 2 tabs or accordions or pages or something...
- horizontal scrollbar for responsive
- create popups of relevant dates on hover
- configure to be able to associate an event with each cell, not necessarily a
  commit. At the moment a cell is just a date in the last year with an
  associated random shade of green.
- count the contributions (randomly generated)
- count the contributions (generated by clicking on each cell click)
- localStorage for the customisable version, to store cell colors
